A simple book management application for a family member.

## Requirements

This CRUD app was created with the following requirements:

This program came about as a request to build a book management system for a non-technical user. With the requirements of storing a books title, author, genre, ratting, read status, and if it's borrowed, its borrower, and its date. The ability to sort books by title, author, and genre. To be user friendly, and to be pretty (if possible.)

The application's book entries are for physical books in a collection in a apartment. The expected number of entries will most likely be less then a thousand entries, with minimal duplicates.

When it comes to read status it's part of ratting system. If not ratted therefore ratted status is To Be Read (TBR).

Builds for the client include being able to run on MacOS, and Chrome OS. Since Chrome OS can run Linux apps and the client has ran Linux apps on their Chrome Book before, and to keep the build process simple, there will only be a Linux build for Chrome OS. Target builds are going to be MacOS, and Linux. Windows is not a main focus for this project, but in theory could be built and used for Windows. No promises.
